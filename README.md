# Utilities List
- [upload_big_jar.py](https://github.com/hourdays/dbks-utils/blob/main/upload_big_jar.py) allows you to upload files bigger than 10 MB to DBFS and then puts them in a Workspace folder. It needs to be improved because it creates a notebook inside the workspace folder instead of a file but a file cannot be created so we might as well create a notebook with useful code inside to load the jar from the DBFS directory.
- [list_dbks_workspace_notebooks_batch_resume.py](https://github.com/hourdays/dbks-utils/blob/main/list_dbks_workspace_notebooks_batch_resume.py) and [list_dbks_workspace_notebooks_batch_resume_multithreaded.py](https://github.com/hourdays/dbks-utils/blob/main/list_dbks_workspace_notebooks_batch_resume_multithreaded.py) allows you to scan a workspace and list the notebooks in a JSON file; the script can be resumed and one of the script is multithreaded on 5 workers by default. It lacks comparative benchmarks but it took several days to list around 800 000 notebooks with the script that is not multithreaded.
